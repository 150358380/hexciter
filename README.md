Hexciter
========

A hexagon-based arcade-puzzle game.

How to Play
===========

There are two kinds of actions that can be performed on the hexes. Swipe left
to flood, and swipe right to destroy. Flooding changes every linked hex of
the same colour to the top colour in the palette (like a flood fill). The
destroy action affects the same cubes, but destroys them instead.

The hexes in the top right are the palette. The palette shows the upcoming
colours. The order of colours in the palette can be swapped by tapping on it.

Points are earned by destroying hexes. Double points are given by matching
the colour from the palette with the hexes on the board to destroy.

The grey hexes along the left edge of the board are move counters. Each time
you make a move, you use up a grey hex.

The bar on the right is the progress bar. Try to fill up the progress bar by
the time your moves run out. If you run out of moves before filling up the
progress bar, some of the hexes on the board will be disabled, blocking off
potential moves.

When the entire game board has been disabled it's game over.
